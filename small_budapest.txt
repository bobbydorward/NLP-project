By European standards, the Hungarians are relative newcomers. They have lived in the Carpathian Basin for a mere 1,100 years — but during that time they’ve had more than their share of suffering.


The settlement of present-day Hungary goes far back in time. Less than 64 km (40 miles) to the west of Budapest, human traces thought to be half a million years old have been excavated and are now on display at the Hungarian National Museum. The ﬁrst tribes that came to this area brought skills and tools which improved the lot of the hunter, made farming feasible, and, in time, gave rise to primitive industries.
