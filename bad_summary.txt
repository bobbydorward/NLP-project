Hungary remained beyond the reach of western Europe until the first century a.d., when the Roman legions advanced and pushed its northeast frontier to the Danube.

Hungary was effectively dismembered: the north and west fell to the Habsburgs; Transylvania became a so-called independent principality under Turkish auspices; and central Hungary came under rule.

In 1867, under a compromise designed to curtail home-rule agitation, the empire was established and Hungary was ﬁnally granted its own government, though key ministries were shared with the Austrians.

Hungary was the ﬁrst country to draw back its West.

In 1997 Hungary was NATO.
